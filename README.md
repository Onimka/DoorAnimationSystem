# DoorAnimationSystem
The system is written for those who are tired of animating the opening/ closing of doors, chests and other similar objects.
  It is especially useful for those games where you want to make a variety of interactive objects, for example for horror games.
  Ability to configure in the inspector:
-Opening/closing time, and animation curve.
-The sounds that accompany these processes, and their volume separately.
-Check for the presence of a key to this door.
-Shaking the door, simulating pulling on the handle of a closed door.
-Axis of rotation, which allows you to use the script as well for hatches, chests, etc.

All you need to do is add a script to your door.
